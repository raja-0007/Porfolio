This is my portfolio website that showcases my skillset and projects i have done so far as well as my level of designing web applications.
I have used "react-scroll" module for smooth scrolling over the website components.
Also i have used "swiperjs" module for the display of my projects in the portfolio section.
I have used "Emailjs" module inorder to give access to the users to contact me.
I have used "bootstrap" and css "media queries" to make this website responsive
